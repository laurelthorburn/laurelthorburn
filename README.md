## About Me:
I am a (future) full stack developer currently working as an audiologist. Born and raised in Nova Scotia, Canada, I now reside in Colorado with my husband and two dogs. I moved to Colorado in 2013 to pursue my doctorate and currently am employed at Kaiser Permanente. I pride myself on being a strong team member, independent learner, and love a challenge (except when it involves getting a lid off a jam jar). I originally pursued computer science in college and am excited to achieve this dream over a decade later. Want to learn more? Let's talk about how I can contribute to your team.
